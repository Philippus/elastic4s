# Counting

A count request executes a query and returns a count of the number of matching documents for that query.
It can be executed across one or more indices. The query can be omitted for a total count across the indexes.

To count all documents in an index regardless of type, we can do this.

```scala
client.execute {
  count from "places"
}
```

Or then narrow it down by a type.

```scala
client.execute {
  count from "places"->"london"
}
```

We can do multiple indexes at once.

```scala
client.execute {
  count from Seq("places", "movies")
}
```

We can include a query to narrow down the results.

```scala
client.execute {
  count from "places" -> "london" where "borough" -> "westminster"
}
```

Also `where` is a synonym for `query`, so you could do

```scala
client.execute {
  count from "places" -> "london" query "borough" -> "westminster"
}
```

You can include any part of the QueryDSL inside the where clause.
