Elastic4s is a concise, idiomatic, reactive, type safe Scala client for Elasticsearch. The client can be used over both HTTP and TCP  by choosing either of the `elastic4s-http` or `elastic4s-tcp` submodules. The official Elasticsearch Java client can of course be used in Scala, but due to Java's syntax it is more verbose and it naturally doesn't support classes in the core Scala core library nor Scala idioms.

Elastic4s's DSL allows you to construct your requests programatically, with syntactic and semantic errors manifested at compile time, and uses standard Scala futures to enable you to easily integrate into an asynchronous workflow. The aim of the DSL is that requests are written in a builder-like way, while staying broadly similar to the Java API or Rest API. Each request is an immutable object, so you can create requests and safely reuse them, or further copy them for derived requests. Because each request is strongly typed your IDE or editor can use the type information to show you what operations are available for any request type.

Elastic4s supports Scala collections so you don't have to do tedious conversions from your Scala domain classes into Java collections. It also allows you to index and read classes directly using typeclasses so you don't have to set fields or json documents manually. These typeclasses are generated using your favourite json library - modules exist for Jackson, Circe, Json4s, PlayJson and Spray Json. The client also uses standard Scala durations to avoid the use of strings or primitives for duration lengths.

## Introduction

Elasticsearch (on the JVM) has two interfaces. One is the regular HTTP interface available on port 9200 (by default) and the other is a TCP interface on port 9300 (by default). Historically the Java API provided by Elasticsearch has always been TCP based with the rationale that it saves marshalling requests into JSON and is cluster aware and so can route requests to the correct node. Therefore elastic4s was also TCP based since it delegates requests to the underlying Java client.

Starting with elastic4s 5.2.x a new [HTTP client](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/tree/master/elastic4s-http) has been added which relies on the Java REST client for connection management, but still uses the familiar elastic4s DSL to build the queries so you don't have to. As of version 5.4.x the HTTP client is now considered production ready after extensive testing on the 5.2 and 5.3 release chains.

Depending on which client you use, you will need to add either `elastic-http` or `elastic-tcp` dependencies to your build.

#### Release

Elastic4s is released for both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12. Scala 2.10 support has been dropped starting with the 5.0.x release train. For releases that are compatible with earlier versions of Elasticsearch,
[search maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.sksamuel.elastic4s%22).
For more information read [Using Elastic4s in your project](#using-elastic4s-in-your-project).

Starting from version 5.0.0, the underlying Elasticsearch TCP Java client has dependencies on Netty, Lucene and others that it does not bring in transitively. The elastic4s tcp client brings in the dependencies for you, but in case anything is missed, you would need to add it to your build yourself.

The second issue is that it uses Netty 4.1. However some popular projects such as Spark and Play currently use 4.0 and there is a breaking change between the two versions. Therefore if you bring in elastic4s tcp (or even just the elasticsearch Java TCP client) you will get `NoSuchMethodException`s if you try to use it with Play or Spark. I am unaware of a workaround at present, until Spark and Play update to the latest version, other than switching to the HTTP client.

## Quick Start

We have created sample projects for http, tcp in both sbt, maven and gradle. Check them out here:
https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/tree/master/samples

To get started you will need to add a dependency to either

* [elastic4s-http](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-http)
* [elastic4s-tcp](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-tcp)

depending on which client you intend you use (or both).

The basic usage is that you create an instance of a client and then invoke the `execute` method with the requests you
want to perform. The execute method is asynchronous and will return a standard Scala `Future[T]` where T is the response
type appropriate for your request type. For example a _search_ request will return a response of type `SearchResponse`
which contains the results of the search.

To create an instance of the HTTP client, use the `HttpClient` companion object methods. To create an instance of the
TCP client, use the `TcpClient` companion object methods. Requests are the same for either client, but response classes
may vary slightly as the HTTP response classes model the returned JSON whereas the TCP response classes wrap the Java
client classes.

Requests are created using the elastic4s DSL. For example to create a search request, you would do:

```scala
search("index" / "type").query("findthistext")`
```

The DSL methods are located in the `ElasticDsl` trait which needs to be imported or extended. Although the syntax is
identical whether you use the HTTP or TCP client, you must import the appropriate trait
(`com.sksamuel.elastic4s.ElasticDSL` for TCP or `com.sksamuel.elastic4s.http.ElasticDSL` for HTTP) depending on which
client you are using.

### Example SBT Setup

```scala
// major.minor are in sync with the elasticsearch releases
val elastic4sVersion = "x.x.x"
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-core" % elastic4sVersion,

  // for the http client
  "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-http" % elastic4sVersion,

  // if you want to use reactive streams
  "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-streams" % elastic4sVersion,

  // testing
  "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-testkit" % elastic4sVersion % "test",
  "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-embedded" % elastic4sVersion % "test"
)
```

### Example Application

An example is worth 1000 characters so here is a quick example of how to connect to a node with a client, create and
index and index a one field document. Then we will search for that document using a simple text query.

```scala
object ArtistIndex extends App {

  // spawn an embedded node for testing
  val localNode = LocalNode("mycluster", "/tmp/datapath")

  // in this example we create a client attached to the embedded node, but
  // in a real application you would provide the HTTP address to the HttpClient constructor.
  val client = localNode.http(true)

  // we must import the dsl
  import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.http.ElasticDsl._

  // Next we create an index in advance ready to receive documents.
  // await is a helper method to make this operation synchronous instead of async
  // You would normally avoid doing this in a real program as it will block
  // the calling thread but is useful when testing
  client.execute {
    createIndex("artists").mappings(
      mapping("modern").fields(
        textField("name")
      )
    )
  }.await

  // Next we index a single document which is just the name of an Artist.
  // The RefreshPolicy.IMMEDIATE means that we want this document to flush to the disk immmediately.
  // see the section on Eventual Consistency.
  client.execute {
    indexInto("artists" / "modern").doc("name" -> "L.S. Lowry").refresh(RefreshPolicy.IMMEDIATE)
  }.await

  // now we can search for the document we just indexed
  val resp = client.execute {
    search("artists") query "lowry"
  }.await

  // resp is an Either of a RequestFailure instance containing the elasticsearch error details,
  // or a RequestSuccess instance that depends on the type of request.
  // In this case it is a RequestSuccess[SearchResponse]

  println("---- Search Results ----")
  resp match {
    case Left(failure) => println("We failed " + failure.error)
    case Right(results) => println(results.result.hits)
  }

  client.close()
}
```

## Eventual Consistency

Elasticsearch is eventually consistent. This means when you index a document it is not normally immediately available to be searched,
but queued to be flushed to the indexes on disk. By default flushing occurs every second but this can be reduced (or increased) for bulk inserts.
Another option, which you saw in the quick start guide, was to set the refresh policy to `IMMEDIATE` which will force a flush straight away.
You shouldn't use IMMEDIATE for heavy loads as you'll cause contention with elastic constantly flushing to disk.

For more in depth examples keep reading.

## Syntax

Here is a list of the common requests and the syntax used to create them and whether they are supported by the TCP or HTTP client. If the HTTP client does not support them, you will need to fall back to the TCP, or use the Java client and build the JSON yourself. Or even better, raise a PR with the addition. For more details on each request click
through to the readme page. For options that are not yet documented, refer to the Elasticsearch documentation asthe DSL closely mirrors the standard Java API / REST API.

## Connecting to a Cluster

To connect to a stand alone elasticsearch cluster we use the methods on the HttpClient or TcpClient companion objects.
For example, `TcpClient.transport` or `HttpClient.apply`. These methods accept an instance of `ElasticsearchClientUri`
which specifies the host, port and cluster name of the cluster. The cluster name does not need to be specified if it is the
default, which is "elasticsearch" but if you changed it you must specify it in the uri.

Please note that the TCP interface uses port 9300 and HTTP uses 9200 (unless of course you have changed these in your cluster).

Here is an example of connecting to a TCP cluster with the standard settings.

```scala
val client = TcpClient.transport(ElasticsearchClientUri("host1", 9300))
```

For multiple nodes it's better to use the elasticsearch client uri connection string.
This is in the format `"elasticsearch://host1:port2,host2:port2,...?param=value&param2=value2"`. For example:

```scala
val uri = ElasticsearchClientUri("elasticsearch://foo:1234,boo:9876?cluster.name=mycluster")
val client = TcpClient.transport(uri)
```

If you need to pass settings to the client, then you need to invoke `transport` with a settings object.
For example to specify the cluster name (if you changed the default then you must specify the cluster name).

```scala
import org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings
val settings = Settings.builder().put("cluster.name", "myClusterName").build()
val client = TcpClient.transport(settings, ElasticsearchClientUri("elasticsearch://somehost:9300"))
```

If you already have a handle to a Node in the Java API then you can create a client from it easily:
```scala
val node = ... // node from the java API somewhere
val client = TcpClient.fromNode(node)
```

Here is an example of connecting to a HTTP cluster.

```scala
val client = HttpClient(ElasticsearchClientUri("localhost", 9200))
```

The http client internally uses the Apache Http Client, which we can customize by passing in two callbacks.

```scala
val client = HttpClient(ElasticsearchClientUri("localhost", 9200), new RequestConfigCallback {
    override def customizeRequestConfig(requestConfigBuilder: Builder) = ...
    }
  }, new HttpClientConfigCallback {
    override def customizeHttpClient(httpClientBuilder: HttpAsyncClientBuilder) = ...
  })
```

## X-Pack-Security

Elastic4s also supports the xpack-security add on (TCP client only). To use this, add the `elastic-xpack-security` dependency to your build and create a client using the `XPackElasticClient` object instead of the `ElasticClient` object. Eg,

scala
```
val client = XPackElasticClient(settings, uri, <plugins>...)
```

If you are using SBT then you might need to add a resolver to the elasticsearch repo.

scala
```
resolvers += "elasticsearch-releases" at "https://artifacts.elastic.co/maven
```

## Embedded Node

A locally configured node and client can be created by including the elastic4s-embedded module. Then a local node can be started by invoking `LocalNode()` with the cluster name and data path. From the local node we can return a handle to the client by invoking the `elastic4sclient` function.

```scala
import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.ElasticClient
val node = LocalNode(clusterName, pathHome)
val client = node.elastic4sclient()
```

To specify settings for the local node you can pass in a settings object like this:
```scala
val settings = Settings.builder()
      .put("cluster.name", "elasticsearch")
      .put("path.home", "mypath")
      .put("http.enabled", false)
      .build()
val node = LocalNode(settings)
val client = node.elastic4sclient(<shutdownNodeOnClose>)
```

If `shutdownNodeOnClose` is true, then once close is called on the client, the local node will be stopped. Otherwise you will manage the lifecycle of the local node yourself (stopping it before exiting the process).

## Create Index

All documents in Elasticsearch are stored in an index. We do not need to tell Elasticsearch in advance what an index
will look like (eg what fields it will contain) as Elasticsearch will adapt the index dynamically as more documents are added, but we must at least create the index first.

To create an index called "places" that is fully dynamic we can simply use:

```scala
client.execute { createIndex("places") }
```

We can optionally set the number of shards and / or replicas

```scala
client.execute { createIndex("places") shards 3 replicas 2 }
```

Sometimes we want to specify the properties of the fields in the index in advance.
This allows us to manually set the type of the field (where Elasticsearch might infer something else) or set the analyzer used,
or multiple other options

To do this we add mappings:

```scala
import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.mappings.FieldType._
import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.StopAnalyzer

client.execute {
    createIndex("places") mappings (
        mapping("cities") as (
            keywordField("id"),
            textField("name") boost 4,
            textField("content") analyzer StopAnalyzer
        )
    )
}
```

Then Elasticsearch is configured with those mappings for those fields only.
It is still fully dynamic and other fields will be created as needed with default options. Only the fields specified will have their type preset.

More examples on the create index syntax can be [found here](https://sksamuel.github.io/elastic4s/docs/indices/createindex.html).

## Analyzers

Analyzers control how Elasticsearch parses the fields for indexing. For example, you might decide that you want
whitespace to be important, so that "band of brothers" is indexed as a single "word" rather than the default which is
to split on whitespace. There are many advanced options available in analayzers. Elasticsearch also allows us to create
custom analyzers. For more details [read about the DSL support for analyzers](https://sksamuel.github.io/elastic4s/docs/misc/analyzers.html).

## Indexing

To index a document we need to specify the index and type and optionally we can set an id.
If we don't include an id then elasticsearch will generate one for us.
We must also include at least one field. Fields are specified as standard tuples.

```scala
client.execute {
  indexInto("places" / "cities") id "uk" fields (
    "name" -> "London",
    "country" -> "United Kingdom",
    "continent" -> "Europe",
    "status" -> "Awesome"
  )
}
```

There are many additional options we can set such as routing, version, parent, timestamp and op type.
See [official documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/index_/) for additional options, all of
which exist in the DSL as keywords that reflect their name in the official API.

## Indexing Typeclass

Sometimes it is useful to index directly from your domain model, and not have to create maps of fields inline. For this
elastic4s provides the `Indexable` typeclass. Simply provide an implicit instance of `Indexable[T]` in scope for any
class T that you wish to index, and then you can use `doc(t)` on the index request. For example:

```scala
// a simple example of a domain model
case class Character(name: String, location: String)

// how you turn the type into json is up to you
implicit object CharacterIndexable extends Indexable[Character] {
  override def json(t: Character): String = s""" { "name" : "${t.name}", "location" : "${t.location}" } """
}

// now the index request reads much cleaner
val jonsnow = Character("jon snow", "the wall")
client.execute {
  indexInto("gameofthrones" / "characters").doc(jonsnow)
}
```

Some people prefer to write typeclasses manually for the types they need to support. Other people like to just have
it done automagically. For those people, elastic4s provides extensions for the well known Scala Json libraries that
can be used to generate Json generically.

Simply add the import for your chosen library below and then with those implicits in scope, you can now pass any type
 you like to `doc` and an Indexable will be derived automatically.

| Library | Elastic4s Module | Import |

## Searching

Searching is naturally the most involved operation.
There are many ways to do [searching in elastic search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/) and that is reflected
in the higher complexity of the query DSL.

To do a simple text search, where the query is parsed from a single string
```scala
search("places" / "cities").query("London")
```

That is actually an example of a SimpleStringQueryDefinition. The string is implicitly converted to that type of query.
It is the same as specifying the query type directly:

```scala
search("places" / "cities"),query(simpleStringQuery("London"))
```

The simple string example is the only time we don't need to specify the query type.
We can search for everything by not specifying a query at all.
```scala
search("places" / "cities")
```

We might want to limit the number of results and / or set the offset.
```scala
search("places" / "cities") query "paris" start 5 limit 10
```

We can search against certain fields only:
```scala
search("places" / "cities") query termQuery("country", "France")
```

Or by a prefix:
```scala
search("places" / "cities") query prefixQuery("country", "France")
```

Or by a regular expression (slow, but handy sometimes!):
```scala
search("places" / "cities") query regexQuery("country", "France")
```

There are many other types, such as range for numeric fields, wildcards, distance, geo shapes, matching.

Read more about search syntax: [Search]
Read about [Multisearch].
Read about [Suggestions].

## HitReader Typeclass

By default Elasticsearch search responses contain an array of `SearchHit` instances which contain things like the id,
index, type, version, etc as well as the document source as a string or map. Elastic4s provides a means to convert these
back to meaningful domain types quite easily using the `HitReader[T]` typeclass.

Provide an implementation of this typeclass, as an in scope implicit, for whatever type you wish to marshall search responses into, and then you can call `to[T]` or `safeTo[T]` on the response.
The difference between to and safeTo is that to will drop any errors and just return successful conversions, whereas safeTo returns
a sequence of `Either[Throwable, T]`.

A full example:

```scala
case class Character(name: String, location: String)

implicit object CharacterHitReader extends HitReader[Character] {
  override def read(hit: Hit): Either[Throwable, Character] = {
    Right(Character(hit.sourceAsMap("name").toString, hit.sourceAsMap("location").toString))
  }
}

val resp = client.execute {
  search("gameofthrones" / "characters").query("kings landing")
}.await // don't block in real code

// .to[Character] will look for an implicit HitReader[Character] in scope
// and then convert all the hits into Characters for us.
val characters :Seq[Character] = resp.to[Character]

```

This is basically the inverse of the `Indexable` typeclass. And just like Indexable, the json modules provide implementations
out of the box for any types. The imports are the same as for the Indexable typeclasses.

As a bonus feature of the Jackson implementation, if your domain object has fields called `_timestamp`, `_id`, `_type`, `_index`, or
`_version` then those special fields will be automatically populated as well.

## Highlighting

Elasticsearch can annotate results to show which part of the results matched the queries by using highlighting.
Just think when you're in google and you see the snippets underneath your results - that's what highlighting does.

We can use this very easily, just add a highlighting definition to your search request, where you set the field or fields to be highlighted. Viz:

```scala
search in "music" / "bios" query "kate bush" highlighting (
  highlight field "body" fragmentSize 20
)
```

All very straightforward. There are many options you can use to tweak the results. In the example above I have
simply set the snippets to be taken from the field called "body" and to have max length 20. You can set the number of fragments to return, seperate queries to generate them and other things. See the elasticsearch page on [highlighting](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html) for more info.

## Get

Sometimes we don't want to search and want to retrieve a document directly from the index by id.
In this example we are retrieving the document with id 'coldplay' from the bands/rock index and type.

```scala
client.execute {
 get("coldplay").from("bands" / "rock")
}
```

We can get multiple documents at once too. Notice the following multiget wrapping block.

```scala
client.execute {
  multiget(
    get("coldplay").from("bands" / "rock"),
    get("keane").from("bands" / "rock")
  )
}
```

See more [get examples] and usage of [Multiget] here.

## Deleting

In the rare case that we become tired of a band we might want to remove them. Naturally we wouldn't want to remove Chris Martin and boys so we're going to remove U2 instead.
We think they're a little past their best (controversial). This operation assumes the id of the document is "u2".

```scala
client.execute {
  delete("u2").from("bands/rock")
}
```

We can take this a step further by deleting by a query rather than id.
In this example we're deleting all bands where their type is pop.

```scala
client.execute {
  deleteIn("bands").by(termQuery("type", "pop"))
}
```

See more about delete on the [delete page]

## Updates

We can update existing documents without having to do a full index, by updating a partial set of fields.

```scala
client.execute {
  update(25).in("scifi" / "starwars"). docAsUpsert (
    "character" -> "chewie",
    "race" -> "wookie"
  )
}
```

For more examples see the [Update] page.

## More like this

If you want to return documents that are "similar" to  a current document we can do that very easily with the more like this query.

```scala
client.execute {
  search("drinks" / "beer") query {
    moreLikeThisQuery("name").likeTexts("coors", "beer", "molson") minTermFreq 1 minDocFreq 1
  }
}
```

For all the options see [here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/mlt-query/).

## Bulk Operations

Elasticsearch is fast. Roundtrips are not. Sometimes we want to wrestle every last inch of performance and a useful way
to do this is to batch up requests. Elastic has guessed our wishes and created the bulk API. To do this we simply
wrap index, delete and update requests using the `bulk` keyword and pass to the `execute` method in the client.

```scala
client.execute {
  bulk (
    index into "bands/rock" fields "name"->"coldplay",
    index into "bands/rock" fields "name"->"kings of leon",
    index into "bands/pop" fields (
      "name" -> "elton john",
      "best_album" -> "tumbleweed connection"
    )
  )
}
```
A single HTTP or TCP request is now needed for 4 operations. In addition Elasticsearch can now optimize the requests,
by combinging inserts or using aggressive caching.

The example above uses simple documents just for clarity of reading; the usual optional settings can still be used.
See more information on the [Bulk].

## Json Output

It can be useful to see the json output of requests in case you wish to tinker with the request in a REST client or your browser. It can be much easier to tweak a complicated query when you have the instant feedback of the HTTP interface.

Elastic4s makes it easy to get this json where possible. Simply invoke the `show` method on the client with a request to get back a json string. Eg:

```scala
val json = client.show {
  search("music" / "bands") query "coldplay"
}
println(json)
```

Not all requests have a json body. For example _get-by-id_ is modelled purely by http query parameters, there is no json body to output. And some requests aren't supported by the show method - you will get an implicit not found error during compliation if that is the case

Also, as a reminder, the TCP client does not send JSON to the nodes, it uses a binary protocol, so the provided JSON should be used as a debugging tool only. For the HTTP client the output is exactly what is sent.

## Synchronous Operations

All operations are normally asynchronous. Sometimes though you might want to block - for example when doing snapshots or when creating the initial index. You can call `.await` on any operation to block until the result is ready. This is especially useful when testing.

```scala
val resp = client.execute {
  index("bands" / "rock") fields ("name"->"coldplay", "debut"->"parachutes")
}.await
```

## Search Iterator

Sometimes you may wish to iterate over all the results in a search, without worrying too much about handling futures, and re-requesting
via a scroll. The `SearchIterator` will do this for you, although it will block between requests. A search iterator is just an implementation
of `scala.collection.Iterator` backed by elasticsearch queries.

To create one, use the iterate method on the companion object, passing in the http client, and a search request to execute. The
search request must specify a keep alive value (which is used by elasticsearch for scrolling).

```scala
implicit val reader : HitReader[MyType] =  ...
val iterator = SearchIterator.iterate[MyType](client, search(index).matchAllQuery.keepAlive("1m").size(50))
iterator.foreach(println)
```

For instance, in the above we are bringing back all documents in the index, 50 results at a time, marshalled into
instances of `MyType` using the implicit `HitReader` (see the section on HitReaders). If you want just the raw
elasticsearch `Hit` object, then use `SearchIterator.hits`

Note: Whenever the results in a particular
batch have been iterated on, the `SearchIterator` will then execute another query for the next batch and block waiting on that query.
So if you are looking for a pure non blocking solution, consider the reactive streams implementation. However, if you just want a
quick and simple way to iterate over some data without bringing back all the results at once `SearchIterator` is perfect.

## DSL Completeness

As it stands the Scala DSL covers all of the common operations - index, create, delete, delete by query, search, validate, percolate, update, explain, get, and bulk operations.
There is good support for the various settings for each of these - more so than the Java client provides in the sense that more settings are provided in a type safe manner.

However there are settings and operations (mostly admin / cluster related) that the DSL does not yet cover (pull requests welcome!).
In these cases it is necessary to drop back to the Java API.
This can be done by calling .java on the client object to get the underlying java elastic client,

```scala
client.java.admin.cluster.prepareHealth.setWaitForEvents(Priority.LANGUID).setWaitForGreenStatus().execute().actionGet
```

This way you can still access everything the normal Java client covers in the cases
where the Scala DSL is missing a construct, or where there is no need to provide a DSL.

## Elastic Reactive Streams

Elastic4s has an implementation of the [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) api for both publishing and subscribing that is built
using Akka. To use this, you need to add a dependency on the elastic4s-streams module.

There are two things you can do with the reactive streams implementation. You can create an elastic subscriber, and have that
stream data from some publisher into elasticsearch. Or you can create an elastic publisher and have documents streamed out to subscribers.

### Integrate

First you have to add an additional dependeny to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-streams" % "x.x.x"
```

or

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-http-streams" % "x.x.x"
```

Import the new API with

```scala
import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.streams.ReactiveElastic._
```

### Publisher

An elastic publisher can be created for any arbitrary query you wish, and then using the efficient search scroll API, the entire dataset that matches your query is streamed out to subscribers.

And make sure you have an Akka Actor System in implicit scope

`implicit val system = ActorSystem()`

Then create a publisher from the client using any query you want. You must specify the scroll parameter, as the publisher
uses the scroll API.

`val publisher = client.publisher(search in "myindex" query "sometext" scroll "1m")`

Now you can add subscribers to this publisher. They can of course be any type that adheres to the reactive-streams api,
so you could stream out to a mongo database, or a filesystem, or whatever custom type you want.

`publisher.subscribe(someSubscriber)`

If you just want to stream out an entire index then you can use the overloaded form:

`val publisher = client.publisher("index1", keepAlive = "1m")`

### Subscription

An elastic subcriber can be created that will stream a request to elasticsearch for each item produced by a publisher.
The subscriber can create index, update, or delete requests, so is a good way to synchronize datasets.

`import ReactiveElastic._`

And make sure you have an Akka Actor System in implicit scope.

`implicit val system = ActorSystem()`

Then create a subscriber, specifying the following parameters:

* A type parameter that is the type of object that the publisher will provide
* How many documents should be included per index batch (10-100 is usually good)
* How many concurrent batches should be in flight (usually around the number of cores)
* An optional `ResponseListener` that will be notified for each item that was successfully acknowledged by the es cluster
* An optional function that will be called once the subscriber has received all data. Defaults to a no-op
* An optional function to call if the subscriber encouters an error. Defaults to a no-op.

In addition there should be a further implicit in scope of type `RequestBuilder[T]` that will accept objects of T (the type produced by your publisher) and build an index, update, or delete request suitable for dispatchin to elasticsearch.

```scala
implicit val builder = new RequestBuilder[SomeType] {
  import ElasticDsl._
  // the request returned doesn't have to be an index - it can be anything supported by the bulk api
  def request(t: T): BulkCompatibleDefinition =  index into "index" / "type" fields ....
}
```
Then the subscriber can be created, and attached to a publisher:

```scala
val subscriber = client.subscriber[SomeType](batchSize, concurrentBatches, () => println "all done")
publisher.subscribe(subscriber)
```

## Using Elastic4s in your project

For gradle users, add (replace 2.12 with 2.11 for Scala 2.11):

```groovy
compile 'com.sksamuel.elastic4s:elastic4s-core_2.12:x.x.x'
```

For SBT users simply add:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.sksamuel.elastic4s" %% "elastic4s-core" % "x.x.x"
```

For Maven users simply add (replace 2.12 with 2.11 for Scala 2.11):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sksamuel.elastic4s</groupId>
    <artifactId>elastic4s-core_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

Check for the latest released versions on [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.sksamuel.elastic4s%22)

## Building and Testing

This project is built with SBT. So to build
```
sbt compile
```

And to test
```
sbt test
```

Integration tests run on a local elastic that is created and torn down as part of the tests inside your standard temp
folder. There is no need to configure anything externally.

###### 6.0.0

* HTTP Client should now be the first choice client. The TCP Client has been deprecated as it will be removed in version 7 of elasticsearch itself. See https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-5-6-0-released. Specifically, _HTTP client will become the official way for Java applications to communicate with Elasticsearch, replacing the Transport Client, which will be removed in Elasticsearch 7.0._.
* HTTP Client no longer has a dependency on the main elasticsearch jars - no more version clashes (netty!) and a hugely reduced footprint.
* HTTP operations now return Either[RequestFailure, RequestSuccess[U]] for better error handling. Each of `RequestFailure` and `RequestSuccess` contain the http status code, the full json response body, and any http headers, in addition to either the error details or the request resposne type.
* Any methods deprecated before version 5.0.0 have been removed.
* Operations that accept an index and a type have been deprecated in favour of index only operations. This is because Elasticsearch plan to remove types in version 7, and in version 6 you are limited to a single type per index. See - https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-6-0-0-alpha1-released
* Deprecated implicit conversion of a tuple to an index/type has been removed. So instead of "index" -> "type", you should use "index" / "type", which has been the default since 2.4.0. Or even better, don't use the type at all anymore, see point above.
* The String field type has been removed, which has been deprecated since 5.0.0. Use textField or keywordField.
* Added doc values to search requests
* Reworked the HTTP aggregation response API to support better types and subaggs
* disableCoord has been removed from bool and common term queries
* Added getIndex request type
* `getAliases` is now overloaded to accept seq of Index and Alias objects to make it clearer how it works. The existing `getAlias` is deprecated.

* Added aliases when creating indexes
* Removed hard coded defaults from all token filters
* Added suport for new Join Type fields (used by parent / child mappings)

###### 5.0.0

Elasticsearch 5.0 is a huge release from the people at Elastic. There have been some queries and actions removed completely, and plenty of methods have been renamed or changed. The full breaking changes log in Elasticsearch itself is here:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes-5.0.html

These are the majority of changes in the scala client. As part of upgrading, there will certainly be some tweaking required.

* TTL has been removed. As a replacement, you should use time based indexes or cron a delete-by-query with a range query on a timestamp field.
* Scala specific enums have (mostly) been removed in favour of using the Java Enums provided by the Java client.
* Infix notation has (mostly) been deprecated
* New typeclass `HitReader` for reading data from searches. This typeclass handles errors (it returns `Either[Throwable, T]`) and now works for search, get, multisearch and multiget.
* PercolatorQuery has been added (Elasticsearch have removed the previous percolator actions)
* Scala specific re-index has been removed and the elasticsearch re-index action has been added #556
* Update by query is now a plugin in Elasticsearch and so has been added to the client #616
* Delete by query is now a plugin in Elasticsearch and so has been added to the client #616
* Rollover has been added #658
* Suggestions action has been removed in Elasticsearch, suggestions are now available on the search action
* Search API has methods for getting the correct suggestion result back, eg `resp.termSuggestion("mysugg1")`
* Multimatchquery now supports boosting individual fields #545
* Existing bool syntax has been deprecated in favour of a more explicit syntax #580
* Terms lookup query has been added #631
* Terms query now supports Iterables #597 #599
* New module added for embedded nodes
* `successFn` has been added to elastic-streams. This is only invoked if there are no errors. #615
* Cluster health supports parameters #600
* Added indices options to GetSettings
* Removed most of the methods deprecated prior to 2.0
* Create template now supports alias #652
* Fixed bug in docAsUpsert #651 #592
* Support predefined Analyzers / Filters #602
* Support for predefined language-specific stopwords #596
* Support geo_shape queries #639
* More like this request has been removed, use more like this query
* Added better name for update in index into #535
* Allow querying mappings for all types in an index #619
* Add shutdown listener to close local node on JVM exit #655


###### 2.1.1

* #484 Fixed bug in es-streams throwing ClassCastException
* #483 Added overloaded doc method to update to accept indexables

###### 2.1.0

* Optimize was renamed to ForceMerge. The existing optimize method are deprecated and `forceMerge(indexes*)` has been added in its place.
* #395 Added pipeline aggregation definitions
* #458 Added parameters to clear cache operation
* #475 Fixed breaking change in terms query
* `rewrite` was removed from Elasticsearch's matchXXX queries so has been removed in the dsl
* Added [GeoCentroid](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html) aggregation
* Added `terminateAfter` to search definition
* SearchType.SCAN is now deprecated in Elasticsearch
* `count` is deprecated in Elasticsearch and should be replaced with a search with size 0

###### 2.0.1

* #473 Added missing "filter" clause from bool query
* #475 Fixed breaking change in terms query
* #474 Added "item" likes to more like this query

###### 2.0.0

Major upgrade to Elasticsearch 2.0.0 including breaking changes. _Please raise a PR if I've missed any breaking changes._

* In elasticsearch 2.0.0 one of the major changes has been filters have become queries. So in elastic4s this means all methods `xxxFilter` are now `xxxQuery`, eg `hasChildrenFilter` is now `hasChildrenQuery`.
* Some options that existed only on filters like cache and cache key are now removed.
* Fuzzy like this query has been removed (this was removed in elasticsearch itself)
* Script dsl has changed. To create a script to pass into a method, you use `script(script)` or `script(name, script)` with further parameters set using the builder pattern.
* DynamicTemplate dsl `template name <name>` has been removed. Now you supply the full field definition in the dsl method, as such `template(field("price_*", DoubleType))`
* Index_analyzer has been removed in elasticsearch. Use analyzer and then override the analyzer for search with search_analyzer
* MoreLikeThis was removed from elasticsearch in favour of a `moreLikeThisQuery` on a search request.
* `moreLikeThisQuery` has changed camel case (capital L), also now requires the 'like' text as the 2nd method, eg `moreLikeThisQuery("field").text("a")` (both can take varargs as well).
* Search requests now return a richer response type. Previously it returned the java type. The richer type has java style methods so your code will continue to compile, but with deprecation warnings.
* The sorting DSL has changed in that the previous infix style methods are deprecated. So `field sort x` becomes `fieldSort(x)` etc.
* Or and And filters have been removed completely (not changed into queries like other filters). Use a bool query with `must` clauses for and's and `should` clauses for or's.
* Highlight dsl has changed slightly, `highlight field x` is now deprecated in favour of `highlight(x)`
* Delete mapping has been removed (this is removed in elasticsearch itself)
* IndexStatus api has been removed (this was removed in elasticsearch itself)
* Template has been renamed dynamic template (to better match the terminology in elasticsesarch)
* Field and mapping syntax has changed slightly. The implicit `"fieldname" as StringType ...` has been deprecated in favour of `field("fieldname", StringType)` or `stringField()`, `longField`, etc
* In es-streams the ResponseListener has changed to accept a `BulkItemResult` instead of a `BulkItemResponse`
* Multiget now returns a rich scala wrapper in the form of `MultiGetResult`. The richer type has java style methods so your code will continue to compile, but with deprecation warnings.
* GetSegments returns a scala wrapper in the form of `GetSegmentsResult`
* IndexStats returns a scala wrapper in the form `IndexStatsResult`
